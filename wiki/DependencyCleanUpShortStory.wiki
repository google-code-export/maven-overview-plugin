= Introduction =

This document describes how dependencies have been cleaned in maven-overview-plugin with
support of maven-overview-plugin itself.


= Details =

So here we go. We'll clean some dependencies here.
Initial dependency has been like that:

== Step 1 ==
This looks quite messy, but taking a closer look and it can be seen that `doxia-site-renderer` is referenced by our project and also by `maven-reporting-impl` that is also our 1^st^ degree dependency. So we don't need to have explicit dependency for `doxia-site-renderer` (but we want this particular version of it take a look at: [http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Dependency_Management Dependency Management]).

Here is our Dependency overview after removing `doxia-site-renderer`:

== Step 2 ==
Next one to remove is `maven-project`.

== More steps ==
Next dependency removed was `maven-model':

After that `maven-plugin-api` was gone:

And `maven-artifact-manager`:

Also `doxia-core` was transitively included:

Than I used `mvn dependency:analyze` to discover that `maven-settings` have been included for no particular reason:

As well as `plugin-support` after removing witch we ended up with clean dependencies, at least those that are under our control:
